        <div class="title">Welcome to Your New Role as a D&I Change Agent</div>
        <p>You are the Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) for a regional branch of a national law firm. You’ve identified systemic bias in the recruitment and selection processes.</p>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <p>The current recruitment and selection processes in your region exhibit several issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Without much structure the process is open to bias</li>
                <li>Vague criteria (e.g., ‘candidate must be a people person’) which allows people to bend the process in favour of people they like rather than those who perform well</li>
                <li>Inconsistently applied so candidates cannot be fairly compared</li>
                <li>Relies on vague ‘very poor-very good’ assessments of candidates which can be flexed to (dis)advantage candidates</li>
                <li>Panel shares no common mental model about what is being assessed so decisions are inconsistent and often result in no hires being made, which is costly to the firm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To reduce systemic bias, you decide that the content of the recruitment system needs to be redesigned, including new criteria, criteria-related interview questions, and clear rating criteria.</p>
            <p>Your task is to navigate organisational resistance to implement this change effectively.</p>
